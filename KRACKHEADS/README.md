
# Project Title and Description
Autonomous Application Builder-This project automates web application development using a multi-agent AI system. Users can enter a simple text prompt like:
"Create an e-commerce site for handmade crafts"
and the system automatically designs, builds, and deploys a fully functional web application.



## Project Overview
* AI-Driven Website Development → Gives the user ready-to-use websites without going through the hassle of coding and deployment of websites. 
* Seamless Agent Collaboration → Our specialized AI agents handle UI/UX, backend, and deployment.
* Fast Deployment → User gets clickable links deployed by the platform Vercel.
## TECH STACK
* Frontend: React.js 
* Backend: FastAPI
* AI Agents: agent.ai
* Database: MongoDB
* Deployment: Vercel, Render
* Communication: RESTful API/WebSockets
## How It Works
1️⃣ User enters a prompt (e.g., "Build a restaurant reservation system").

2️⃣ Designer Agent creates UI/UX components.

3️⃣ Developer Agent writes frontend & backend code.

4️⃣ Project Manager Agent ensures smooth integration & deployment.

5️⃣ The system deploys the final app, making it live & accessible.
## Future Improvements
* Better local deployment platforms like EC2 instance can be used to enhance user- experience.
* Inclusion of PostgreSQL for better Database management.
* User can opt to Deploy the website on an authorized paid platform with a domain name of his/her choice.
* The website can take in multiple prompts to change the developed website according to user's requirement.
## Conclusion
Our project leverages AI agents to automate the end-to-end web development process, transforming a simple user prompt into a fully deployed website. This project showcases the power of AI in web development, enabling faster, smarter, and more efficient website creation.
